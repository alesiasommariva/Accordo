# Accordo

The aim of the project is the realisation of a prototype client for an online discussion platform. The project is inspired by the 'discord' system, but has numerous differences.
The 'agreement' system presents a single discussion board to which all users have access. The notice board is divided into several channels. Each user can read and write text messages, pictures and can share their position on each channel. Each user can create new channels.
